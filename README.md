# Library-Management-UI-with-Search-Add-and-Remove-Book-Functionality
Create a React-based UI that displays a list of books (each with a title and author). Add a search input box to filter books by title or author as the user types. Provide an input form to add new books to the list, and include a remove button next to each book to delete it from the list.
